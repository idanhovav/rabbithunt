# rabbithunt

This is a challenge offered by UPenn to its students. To read their description, check out http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~matuszek/cit591-2001/Assignments/rabbit-hunt.html.

In short, the program comes pre-made, and the student must fill out one method: the rabbit's decision of movement.

The field of play is a grid populated by bushes, one fox, and one rabbit. As one might expect, the fox aims to eat the rabbit, and the rabbit aims to escape. The fox eats the rabbit by getting to the square the rabbit currently resides on.

I redownloaded this project and cleaned up the code recently. I removed all the class files and extra help files that eclipes populated in the project as well.
